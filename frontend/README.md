# Flowweb

Flowweb offers a streamlined solution by leveraging the power of AI and providing a user-friendly interface. The traditional method of manually coding contracts is replaced by an AI-assisted approach. With Flowweb, developers can create contracts effortlessly by providing a simple prompt. The advanced GPT-3.0 technology then generates complete contract code, saving developers significant time and effort. This AI-powered contract creation feature allows developers, regardless of their coding expertise, to create robust and customized contracts with ease.

Once contracts are created, Flowweb simplifies the deployment process onto the Flow Blockchain. Developers can easily paste their Cadence contract code into the dapp and initiate the deployment process. This eliminates the need for complex manual configurations such as using CLI or different JS libraries and ensures a quick and efficient deployment experience. Flowweb streamlines the deployment process, making it accessible and user-friendly for developers of all levels of expertise.
